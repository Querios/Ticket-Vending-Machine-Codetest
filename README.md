# Ticket-Vending-Machine-Codetest

This is the 10 days progress of the ticket vending machine web application / REST API created for the completion of the codetest.

I decided to learn and use Spring Boot for the API and Vaadin UI for the UI of the web app.

This is also uploaded to Heroku for easier checking of the code. Link: https://java-ticket-vending-machine.herokuapp.com/Home
